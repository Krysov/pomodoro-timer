# React Native Test App

### About
The app is a productivity timer modeled after the _Pomodoro Technique_ and offers a stream lined UI design.
The purpose is to evaluate and learn React Native and its dependencies in a safe, yet production like scenario.
Additionally it serves as a personal exercise with high coverage and component modularity in mind.

### As of Now

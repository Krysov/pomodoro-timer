### About
The purpose of this project is for me (the author)
to broaden my skillset with TypeScript, React Native,
testing with Jest, Enzyme and Detox and get an idea
of what the current state of platform independent
mobile development looks like.
Additionally this will serve as a work example of mine
since my code is usually hidden behind an NDA.
And in general a use of TDD, MVVM and some other practices
and personal hackathon.


### Installation
Setup the React Native CLI environment with npm
https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.60/enviroment-setup
and then run `cd <project root> && npm ci`
to install all dependency packages.
